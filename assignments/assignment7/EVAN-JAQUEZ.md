#### What went well
I was able to actually install the model and the chatbot which is a huge step up from class. 

#### What didn't go well

I couldn't actually run it on my machine. And it loaded for over an hour. Made sure podman was running. I will attend OH next week to see where I went wrong.
Cool Idea wish I got it working
